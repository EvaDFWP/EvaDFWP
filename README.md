- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EvaDFWP
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in network automation with a focus on security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Terraform, scripting, network automation and more.
- âš¡ Fun fact: the live animals featured in The Lord of the Rings were managed so well that the care procedures the crews used were adopted as film industry standards for animal treatment.
